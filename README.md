**This is a discovery. For the canonical source of GOV.UK's infrastructure, see [alphagov/govuk-aws](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws) and [alphagov/govuk-puppet](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet) repos.**

### Who we are

We're the GOV.UK Replatforming team, discovering the future of GOV.UK's infrastructure, one line of code at a time. You can find us in #govuk-replatforming on the GDS Slack, and our [(internal) Trello board exists](https://trello.com/b/u4FCzm53/).
