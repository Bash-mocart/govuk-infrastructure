brew install tfenv
cd terraform/
tfenv install
```

### Documentation

Further documentation about how to perform various tasks can be found [here](./docs)

### Who we are

We're the GOV.UK Replatforming team, discovering the future of GOV.UK's infrastructure, one line of code at a time. You can find us in #govuk-replatforming on the GDS Slack, and our [(internal) Trello board exists](https://trello.com/b/u4FCzm53/).
